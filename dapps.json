As of December 2017, Everipedia is the largest English encyclopedia with more than six million entries, including all English entries of Wikipedia.

To realize this vision, eosDAC is an evolving Decentralised Autonomous Community (DAC) focused on EOS.IO Block Production serving the EOS communities worldwide. In doing this, eosDAC is creating the tools and smart contracts it needs to function. It will share these with the EOS communities to help other DACs thrive on the EOS.IO blockchains.  In order to function as a DAC, eosDAC is creating open source tools and will be sharing them as a DAC Toolkit, that anyone can use, modify to setup and run a DAC.",
